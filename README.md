This is a repository for my chess-based projects.

My first (and currently only) project here is Chesstomise, a Java-based chess application intended for local play.
It features an ASCII-inspired graphic design for its visuals - the chessboard, the pieces, as well as all the inputs,
are represented purely textually, in a way that's still clear to view and read. 

The ruleset, the chessboard, and all of the pieces, are standard, but I'm working on implementing the following:
- Amazon, a piece variant with the powers of the Queen and the Knight combined (promotion-only);
- Chess 960 a.k.a. Fischerandom, a famous rule variant with the back ranks of pieces shuffled within 960 possibilities;
- Duck Chess, a rule variant with its own piece variant called the Duck - a "brick" that gets relocated on every move;
- Rain Chess, my own custom rule variant in which any player can permanently remove their piece instead of moving it.

Once implemented, each of these variants will be freely toggle-able before the start of each game, allowing for unique
combinations not commonly explored in chess software or on chess websites.
